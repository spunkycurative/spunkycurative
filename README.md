ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @spunkycurative - Shreya Sharma
ðŸŒ± Currently diving deep into Verilog HDL, exploring digital design concepts, testbenches, counters, registers, and FIFO implementations.
ðŸ”¬ Interested in RTL Design & Verification, with a future focus on SystemVerilog, UVM, and advanced verification methodologies.
ðŸŽ¯ My goal is to become internship-ready in Design Verification and pursue a career in VLSI (RTL/Verification).

ðŸŒ±Iâ€™m currently learning:
1.Digital Design & RTL fundamentals
2.Verilog HDL (behavioral & structural modeling)
3.Writing testbenches and simulating waveforms
4.Designing counters, registers, and FIFO architectures

ðŸš€ Future Interests:
1.SystemVerilog & UVM
2.RTL Verification methodologies
3.Industry-level VLSI/ASIC verification projects
4.Building strong problem-solving skills for VLSI interviews

ðŸ“‚ Repositories Highlight:
ðŸ“Œ Verilog-based projects including:
1.Range-based Counters
2.Register Set Designs
3.FIFO (Single-clock & Dual-clock)
4.Encoders, Decoders, and Comparators
